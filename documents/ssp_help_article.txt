Specialized Support Profiles & Specialist’s Hub Overview
What are Specialized Support Profiles?
Specialized Support Profiles give support specialists and teachers shared visibility into a student’s areas of needed support, strengths, and progress. Specialized Support Profiles are designed to help support students that receive targeted support (i.e. interventions) or support through an Individualized Education Program (IEP), 504 Support plan, or English Language Development program. These profiles centralize detailed information about each student’s support areas and provide specialists and teachers a space to directly coordinate support strategies within the platform. As a result, teachers and specialists can make more informed decisions about providing differentiated support that drives each student’s growth. With Specialized Support Profiles, teachers and support specialists get:
Shared visibility and easy access to relevant information 
Teachers and specialists can see how one another is planning and implementing supports for each student.
Teachers and specialists can easily access key reference data (e.g., MAP data, student progress in Projects/Units) to help identify appropriate supports and challenges.
Teachers get automatic recommendations for which resources to assign to students in projects and math units, based on the learning needs that specialists identify for each student. 
Ability for teachers and specialists to communicate and collaborate 
In addition to having a shared view of support details, teachers and specialists can also communicate with one another about these details in the platform.
Teachers and specialists can leverage one another’s expertise by sharing recommendations, exchanging resources, and asking questions of one another leading to more coordinated, cohesive, and targeted approaches to supporting each student.
What is the Specialist’s Hub?
Specialist’s Hub
Specialized Support Profiles are created by support specialists—an assigned role in the platform—via the Specialist’s Hub. The Specialist’s Hub provides additional features designed to meet the specific needs of support specialists, such as creating student groups, communicating with other educators, documenting their work, and updating and maintaining a student’s Specialized Support Profile. With the Specialist’s Hub, support specialists get:
A dedicated place to organize and document their work
Specialists can group and monitor the progress of students based on the types of support needed and do so in a way that compliments how they routinely work with students.
Specialists have access to a historical record of decisions and communications around each student’s areas of needed support, strengths, and progress so that this information is on-hand when it’s most helpful.
Specialists can populate the high-impact information within a student’s Specialized Support Profile that equips teachers to make more informed differentiated support decisions during Project/Unit time.

How do I know which students have Specialized Support Profiles?
Students who are part of Specialized Support Groups have their own Specialized Support Profile in the platform. These profiles can be accessed by any specialist or educator who teaches these students. As a teacher, you can view the Specialized Support Profile of any student that is in at least one of your classes. (Learn more about how specialists set up their Specialized Support Groups here.)
To view which students have Specialized Support Profiles:
1. Click any course
2. Click on the Students tab
3. In the Support Profile column, students with a checkmark next to their name have a Specialized Support Profile

If a student changes to another site, the student’s Specialized Support Profile will follow the student and will be visible as long as the student is added to a Support Group at the new site.

Specialists can enter information within the Defined Learning Needs and Areas to Support section of a student’s profile. All teachers who teach the student can view these sections of the profile.

View Student MAP Data
Within each student’s Specialized Support Profile page is a MAP Results section. 

This section displays the details of a student’s Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA) Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) Growth Reading and Math assessments results, including historical data, so that you can easily analyze a student’s growth trends. The student’s last 4 math and reading MAP test results are displayed in the table.
If a student’s MAP results show “MAP data is not available”, this means that the student does not have MAP results to display. 
Further information on MAP testing can be found here. For more information about the MAP Data section and best practices, check out this resource in the Learning Space.

How do I know if an update has been made to a Specialized Support Profile?
Since the Specialized Support Profile is a space for teachers and specialists to collaborate and communicate with one another about the details on a student’s profile, it is important for teachers and specialists to be aware when an update has been made to a Specialized Support Profile.
All teachers and specialists who have access to a student’s Specialized Support Profile will receive a notification in their avatar in the bottom left corner of the platform when updates are made to the student’s profile.

Specialists can also easily view when a Specialized Support Profile was last updated, through their list view on the Specialist’s Hub. In the “Last Activity” column of their list view, the time of the last update to the profile is displayed.
