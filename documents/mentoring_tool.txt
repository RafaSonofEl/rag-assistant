Mentoring Overview
1:1 Mentoring is one of the important pillars of Summit Learning. We know how important it is for children to be truly connected with and cared for by the adults at their school. Through Summit Learning, all students are paired with a mentor who acts as their advocate both inside and outside of the classroom.
A mentor can be a teacher, a school leader, or other administrators at a student’s school. Mentors meet with their students 1:1 regularly and use the Mentoring page in the Platform to support their students in their progress towards their short-term and long-term academic and personal goals.
The Mentoring page in the platform gives teachers more flexibility, predictability, and control over their mentoring schedule–doing so enables teachers to more easily integrate mentoring time into what’s happening in their classrooms. 
Teachers can also see insights around how they are implementing mentoring with their students, as well as data snapshots on how their students are progressing; as a result, teachers can easily know which students to prioritize for check-in scheduling, how to best prepare for each check-in, and how to make sure that every student gets the mentoring time they need.
Within the Mentoring page, mentors can:
Schedule regular check-in meetings
Set a check-in agenda
Follow up on student goals
Take notes
Leave notes for students or for themselves about the students
Review past check-ins
See consolidated data, such as academic data and days since last check-in

How do I create and adjust my Mentoring Schedule? 
The Summit Learning Platform mentoring scheduler gives teachers more flexibility, predictability, and control over their mentoring schedule. This enables teachers to more easily integrate mentoring time into what’s happening in their classrooms. 
There are three views in the scheduler: the List view, Week view, and 2 Weeks view. 
New Mentors
Returning Mentors
Edit Recurring Schedule
Add a Check-in
New Mentors
If you are a new mentor, we recommend that you try the List view before creating a schedule. The List view shows two columns: Remaining Check-ins and Completed Check-ins. Students are first shown in the Remaining Check-ins list and are moved to the Completed Check-ins list after they’ve completed the check-in. The list will restart when all students are moved from the Remaining Check-ins to the Completed Check-ins list. 

You can sort the list by First Name, Last Name, or Date of Last Check-in by clicking the Sort button on the bottom of each list. 

________________________________________________________________________
Returning Mentors
If you are a returning mentor, you may use the week views to create and organize recurring check-in schedules. You can do this by:
Clicking on Create My Schedule.

After adding the time you want to spend each day on mentoring, you can create your master schedule. You can drag and drop students to adjust your schedule from this window.

________________________________________________________________________
Edit Recurring Schedule
To edit the recurring schedule, click Settings at the top of the page. 

Click into the Recurring Check-Ins tab and select Every Week or Every 2 Weeks. Drag and drop the students to the new day you will meet with them.

If you haven’t completed your check-in with the student already, your schedule will update automatically.
________________________________________________________________________
Add a Check-in
If you do not want to change the recurring schedule, you can instead add an additional check-in for a student outside of their regular schedule. Y
You can add the check-in by clicking Add Check-in under the date in the Week or 2 Weeks view.
